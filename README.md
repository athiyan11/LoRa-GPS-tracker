# LoRa-GPS-tracker




Vehicle tracking system is comprehensive security and fleet management Solved. A technology used to locate a vehicle. Various methods such as GPS and other satellite-based navigation systems and the ground station. Modern vehicle tracking systems use GPS technology Monitors and locates vehicles anywhere on earth, but sometimes different 
variety of automated vehicle location technology is also used. Vehicle tracking Effective real-time location and You can also save the data  and download it to your computer  for use Future analysis. This system is an essential device for tracking vehicles Sometimes owners want to keep an eye on it and today it is very popular.  
Those who have an expensive car used for theft prevention and recovery car. The collected data  can be viewed on an electronic map via the Internet, site. Lora is a new private license-free spread spectrum modulation. Technology that can transmit data over very long distances at low rates Minimal power consumption. More importantly, there is no entrance fee Associated with this type of wireless technology. Local Area Network (LAN) such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and ZigBee are  established technologies, so the biggest 
The problem with many LANs is battery consumption and short distances. budget. Otherwise, cellular networks such as LTE are generally enhanced.Data throughput is increased, but power consumption is at a disadvantage. Both LANs and mobile networks are very expensive over large areas.
